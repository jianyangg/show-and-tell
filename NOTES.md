- **Plan ingestion/execution:** `/plans/synthesize` loads a stored `RecordingBundle`, runs it through Gemini 2.5 Pro/GPT-5 when enabled (fallbacks to heuristics otherwise), and persists the structured Plan alongside `/recordings/{id}/plans` and `/plans/{planId}` lookups. `/runs/start` remains goal-driven via Gemini 2.5 Computer Use, while plan-driven execution is the upcoming integration.
- **Runner orchestration:** Playwright control loop, abort handling, and the Computer Use translation layer are in place. Prompt tuning and richer safety/confirmation handling remain future work.
- **Frontend experience:** The bootstrap viewer now includes a timeline scrubber canvas with event badges, pointer overlays, and a plan review panel (steps, variables, locator suggestions). Manual bundle upload and the same-origin iframe recorder both populate the review state; plan synthesis is kicked off directly from the UI.
- **UI layout sanity:** Header controls still drive the Computer Use goal-run loop so we can launch and monitor a headless Playwright session (canvas + event log). The Recording/Review section underneath is the Record → Log → Process → Review flow: capture a bundle, persist it, synthesize a plan, and inspect steps/locators/vars before replay wiring lands.
- **Storage & infra:** Plan storage and run history now flow through repository interfaces with optional Postgres/Redis backends (env-driven). Recording bundles continue to land in the filesystem, and `RunRegistry` still holds live state.
- **Streaming UX:** Live event log + screencast work as before; the review panel now surfaces frame-level context, but the in-run overlays (goal table, assertion inspector) are still pending.
- **Next targets toward PLAN.md:** drive runs from synthesized plans, firm up Postgres migrations/Redis caching before multi-user, and iterate on the review UI (variable editing, assertion preview, confidence scores). Resume richer Computer Use prompts once plan-driven execution is stable.
