AI Debate Server - Routes audio between two Gemini Live API instances

This creates a debate between two AI personas by cross-connecting their audio streams.
Each Gemini instance thinks it's talking to a human, but we route the audio between them.

Setup:
    pip install google-genai websockets pyaudio

Usage:
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    python debate_server.py

The debate will start automatically and stream to any connected browser clients.
